# WIP-Airline-Booking-System

This is a airline ticket booking program. The fare can be set on the code, and the booking situation can be simulated through running the seatmapgen.py

The program will display a seatmap, turning all booked seats red. Then it will ask the user for which seat it wants to book. The user will them be prompted with the ticket fare and a confirmation screen, if the user decides to buy the ticket a bookingID or reservation key is generated and inserted into reservationkey.csv with the prefix [ECO] for Economy Class, [EXEC] for Executive and [FRST] for First Class.
